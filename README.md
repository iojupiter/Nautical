# Nautical
A microservices based application platform for brick 'n mortars in possession of a WiFi network and catering to clients in the service industry to leverage their LAN network for better customer experience by offering useful micro-applications. 
A micro-application is a microservice for a context-based user interaction. For example: a virtual menu or a jukebox.
Micro-applications are selected from a micro-app store and activated by the brick 'n mortar owner through their dashboard.
The brick 'n mortar owner gathers client analytics over time which helps optimise their offerings.
A client enjoys a more personalised and contextualised service experience.
Brick 'n mortars can be anything from restaurants, bars, caf√©s, hotels, museums, universities and even family homes.

# Architecture
The application is modelled using the analogy of a maritime ecosystem. 
The clients are sailors, guided to harbours by a lighthouse in the form of a map search engine. 
Harbours are the brick 'n mortars with WiFi networks. 
Docks are the micro-applications sailors connect to trade.
Harbourmasters are the brick 'n mortar owners.
